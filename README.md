If you want to just watch the full 1.5 hours of content and explanation, here is just the talking content https://www.twitch.tv/videos/622435989?filter=highlights&sort=time

Also, if you just want some music to put the ending music on with no talking, here's the ending stuff I was messing around with.  monome crow (using m18s_macros.lua) is controlled by cong burn strokes, which triggers ^^macros to advance the sequencer and do other modifiers.  The sound from my synth is processed by prosody alliterate and dirge, the latter controlled by the shaper lfo. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/622435988?filter=highlights&sort=time
